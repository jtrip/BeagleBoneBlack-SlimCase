BeagleBoneBlack-SlimCase
========================
Slim Acrylic (laser cut) - top and bottom plates.
 
Measured by hand (calipers) and designed from scratch using QCAD.

### Notes: ###
Thinking about adding 'stacking block' nubs and holes so blocks can be attached. This might also help for holding the 'stacking block' compatible rod for an axle. Since I'm sticking to laser cut this might not be practical so I'll look to other features to make it convenient to connect the plates to other components, like for building a car body around it etc.

__Currently:__ Port Holes could be shrunk to be a little tighter, specifically in the y axis.
